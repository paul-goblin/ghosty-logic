# Ghosty Logic

Ghosty Logic is the Game-Logic of the grid-based logic game Ghosty. It is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The game is built according to the design requirements specified in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7Km6ATHOPSs2d2KR1aVe81VQ3Azccke5e3lNVtMR9M/edit?usp=sharing).

Currently, there is no way to display or interact with the game logic yet. If you wan't to play my old version of Ghosty which already had 45 playable Levels, you can find it [here](https://github.com/paul-goblin/griga_and_projects).

## Game Overview

In Ghosty, players navigate ghosts through a grid, solving challenges to get back to their Bottle.

## Inspiration and Motivation

The Game is highly inspired by the game Pushy. Ghosty aims to implement the idea of Pushy in a more generic way (for example allowing multiple Ghosties and extending the idea of different z-Layers from Pushy Iland) and be open source and free to play. Ultimately Ghosty could become a plattform for players to create and share their custom levels or maybe even custom entities.

## Development

This project is developed using TDD, a software development process where the tests are written before the actual code. This ensures that the code meets its design and behaves as expected.
